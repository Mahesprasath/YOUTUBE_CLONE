# YOUTUBE CLONE WEBSITE
This project is a YouTube clone built using only HTML and CSS. The goal of this project was to replicate the layout and basic design of YouTube to improve my frontend development skills. No JavaScript or backend functionality is implemented, as the focus was entirely on mastering CSS concepts.

Features
Responsive Layout: The design adjusts well on different screen sizes.
Flexbox & Grid Usage: Organized page sections such as the video grid, sidebar, and header.
Positioning Techniques: Applied absolute and relative positioning for elements like the navbar and video thumbnails.
Media Queries: Ensured the layout looks good on both desktop and mobile views.
Concepts Used
Flexbox for aligning elements horizontally and vertically.
CSS Grid for creating a responsive video section.
Positioning (absolute, relative, fixed) to align headers and icons precisely.
Typography for styling the text and buttons.
